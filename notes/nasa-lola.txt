how to get gdal to read the separate .fmt file?
strace shows it doesn't even open it before "CORE_ITEM_BYTES of 0 is not supported in this gdal PDS reader."

does it work if I manually concat the files?

is it possible to supply a list of files to read concatenated together?

start from the working test suite PDS files in gdal?
or at least read them and see how they differ?

read the code for the PDS driver?


gdalinfo on their own test files gives CORE_ITEM_BYTES error

why dont they support these files that are in their test suite?
maybe actually run the test suite
is there some difference between python and c++?
the python bindings, at least the unit tests seem to work
they call ogr.Open


RDR files have PDS tables (time-series/pointcloud-like) rather than PDS raster images

GDAL raster driver
    reads PDS3, PDS4, JPEG, BMP, netCDF, PNG, XYZ (gridded)
    not useful
GDAL vector driver
    reads CSV, GeoJSON, netCDF, PDS3, PDS4
PDAL reads numpy, OBJ, PLY, PCD, text (csv/xyz)
`transform` PDS3 to PDS4
`rdr2*` PDS3 to CSV, XYZ, tab?, table?

ogrinfo seems to work, finds the table at least, but seems empty?

OGR always returns the field type GetType() as string??
there are no GeomFields either

OGR PDS3 driver only supports MSB fields, anything else is read as a string
NASA LOLA RDR data is all LSB
garbage

linux on x86 is little endian
MSB (first) is big endian
LSB (first) is little endian


honestly it's probably easier to just write a struct that matches the LOLARDR.FMT file
does GDAL do any handy coordinate transforms for us?
also it'd be zero copy and probably much faster
also I can use span/ranges
